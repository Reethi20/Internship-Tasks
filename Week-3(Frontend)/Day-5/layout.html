                Zootopia is a vibrant animated adventure set in a modern city inhabited entirely by animals 
                where predator and prey live together in uneasy harmony. 
                The story follows optimistic bunny Judy Hopps, who becomes the first rabbit police officer 
                determined to prove herself in a big, competitive metropolis.
                When a mysterious case involving missing predators emerges, she teams up with a sly fox, 
                Nick Wilde, who initially seems untrustworthy. As they investigate, they uncover a deeper conspiracy 
                that challenges the city’s fragile social balance. The film explores themes of prejudice, stereotypes,
                 ambition, and friendship in a clever and heartfelt way. With sharp humor, thrilling action, and
                emotional depth, it appeals to both children and adults. Ultimately, it delivers a powerful message about embracing diversity and believing in one’s potential.
